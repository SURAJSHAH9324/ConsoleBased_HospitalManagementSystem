Database Integration:

Uses JDBC to connect to a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

Efficiently stores and retrieves data.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for the application.

JDBC: Java Database Connectivity for interacting with the database.

SQL: For database schema design and queries.

OOPs: Object-Oriented Programming principles for modular and reusable code.

MySQL: Relational database management system for storing data.
